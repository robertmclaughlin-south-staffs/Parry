### Colours and background images.

The colours for the main page are a 'vibrant catch the user’s eye’ style, with the image of books made into the current year.
The reviews are left on white background for simplicity, also this makes the images stand out more.
Underneath the background image of a young girl reading with the 3 columns and read more buttons.

The whole theme of the site has a warm, calm, and relaxing tone of images and colours to make the user feel comfortable navigating through the pages.

About.html has an old library background image with the 'Let’s sign you up form'. The Nav bar and 'follow us' is explained below.
Read more and the survey shares the same background image of an open book set onto a backdrop of a sunset.
The columns are set with an opacity % to let the text be seen but not camouflaged with the background image.
All the images in the assets folder were sourced via https://unsplash.com/s/photos/books and converted into jpegs or png's via Flickr.

The nav bar (especially index.html) and the social elements on the footer of (about.html) pages, have been made to look like a book or wooden rails you might see in an old book store or library.



### Links to additional pages are in the assets folder.

[A link to GitHub] (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Love-to-Read)

Using Gitpod or code anywhere and using the terminal $ python3 -m http.server
then using port 8000 will show the web page.

main source code taken and modified from the Code Institute.

### Testing and ensuring pages work

As we are using various platforms to run the code. I found using ../index.html the easiest way to link pages back home.
Otherwise, it would not load and try and link to assets pages.

For mobile use the drop-down links were used on each page as the menu didn't blend in with the chosen background, the only page with one link is the form.html page, as that directs you back home only for ease of use.

### Glitches/Bugs

The pages and links have been tested, and the buttons react well.


### Version control

GitHub (https://github.com/Sniffy2019/Love-to-Read)
Using Gitpod or code anywhere the command line was easier to establish commits. Once using the port 8000 sometimes the changes would lag or not update at all.
